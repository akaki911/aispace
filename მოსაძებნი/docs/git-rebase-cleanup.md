# Git Rebase Cleanup Verification

- Verified that the working tree on branch `work` is clean.
- Confirmed no rebase is in progress and removed any leftover metadata directories if they existed.
- Ensured `.git/rebase-apply` and `.git/rebase-merge` are absent.
- Confirmed there are no index locks blocking Git operations.

This document records the resolution of a previously reported "rebase in progress" warning in tooling and confirms that the repository state is healthy for future development.
